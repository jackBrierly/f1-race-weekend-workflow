Problem Statement:

F1 teams make hundreds of decisions during a race weekend, particularly around car setup changes during Practice and Qualifying. These decisions involve multiple engineers, strict time constraints, and session-based rules that restrict what can be changed once a session begins or a setup becomes locked. In practice, information is often spread across messages, spreadsheets, and verbal communication, making it difficult to clearly track what changed, who approved it, and why.

This lack of a single, reliable source of truth can lead to confusion about the current car setup, duplicate or conflicting changes, unclear responsibility for approvals, difficulty reviewing decisions after a session, and mistakes caused by time pressure or miscommunication.

The goal of this project is to design and build a workflow and decision-tracking system that provides clarity and structure during a race weekend. The system should show the current stage of the weekend, maintain versioned car setups, allow engineers to propose changes, require approvals from authorised roles, enforce session-based rules, and maintain an audit trail of all decisions. By doing so, the system aims to reduce operational errors and give teams a clear, shared understanding of decisions made under pressure.


Roles:

Engineer
- Proposes car setup changes based on driver feedback and session observations.
- Creates change requests with a clear description and reason.
- Adds notes and feedback during sessions.
- Cannot approve changes or bypass locked states.

Lead Engineer
- Reviews and approves or rejects proposed setup changes.
- Authorised to create new setup versions by approving change requests.
- Responsible for decisions made during time-critical sessions.
- Can transition the race weekend workflow between stages (e.g. Practice to Qualifying), which controls what actions are allowed at that time.

Viewer
- Has read-only access to the system.
- Can view current setups, decision history, and audit logs.
- Cannot create, modify, or approve any changes.


Workflow Stages:

Practice
- Focused on experimentation and data gathering.
- Setup changes can be created and iterated without a formal approval step enforced by the system.
- Decisions are collaborative and overseen by senior engineers, though this oversight is not explicitly modelled.
- Notes and feedback are recorded for later review.
Permissions:
- Engineers: create setup versions, record notes.
- Lead Engineers: create setup versions, record notes.
- Approvals: not enforced by the system.

Qualifying
- Focused on performance with stricter controls.
- Engineers can no longer directly edit the current car setup.
- Engineers may propose setup changes for review.
- A Lead Engineer must approve or reject each proposed change.
- Approved changes create a new setup version to preserve traceability.
Permissions:
- Engineers: propose changes, record notes.
- Lead Engineers: approve or reject changes.
- Direct setup edits: not allowed.

Race
- Focused on stability, reliability, and execution.
- Core setup parameters cannot be structurally changed.
- Limited operational adjustments may occur but are not versioned.
- Strategy notes and observations are recorded.
Permissions:
- Engineers: record notes only.
- Lead Engineers: record notes only.
- Setup changes: not allowed.

Review
- Post-session analysis and reflection.
- Teams review setup versions, decisions, and outcomes.
- No changes to setups are permitted.
Permissions:
- Engineers: read-only access.
- Lead Engineers: read-only access.
- Modifications: not allowed.


Data Models:

Team
- Purpose: Represents an organisation (e.g. a racing team) that owns weekends, setups, and decisions.
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: e.g. "McLaren"
  - createdAt: timestamp

Weekend
- Purpose: Represents a single race weekend and the current workflow state.
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: e.g. "Silverstone GP"
  - teamId: link to Team
  - stage: one of Practice, Qualifying, Race, Review

ChangeRequest
- Purpose: A proposed change to the setup that is waiting for a decision.

  - teamId: link to Team
  - baseSetupId: the setup version the proposal is based on
  - status: Pending | Approved | Rejected

  - createdByName: user-entered name
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - decidedByName: Lead Engineer name (if decided)
  - decidedAt: timestamp (if decided)
  - decisionNote: optional context (especially for rejection)

Note
- Purpose: Captures driver feedback or engineer observations tied to a stage/session.
- Fields:
  - id: unique identifier

  - weekendId: link to Weekend
  - teamId: link to Team (denormalised for easy filtering)
  - action: e.g. StageChanged, ChangeProposed, ChangeApproved, ChangeRejected, SetupLocked

  - details: JSON metadata (e.g. previousStage, newStage, versionNumber, reason)


API Endpoints (REST):

Conventions
- All endpoints use JSON request/response bodies.
- Role + name are provided by the client on each request (prototype approach) and enforced server-side.
- Each request specifies the team being worked on, and the API restricts all reads and writes to data belonging to that team.
- The API enforces workflow rules (stage locks, permissions) and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

Definition of Done (Sprint 0)

The planning phase (Sprint 0) is considered complete when:

/ The problem being solved is clearly articulated and scoped.
/ User roles and responsibilities are defined and understood.
/ Workflow stages and their rules are explicitly documented.
/ Core data models are defined with clear purposes and fields.
/ REST API endpoints are specified and aligned with the workflow.
/ Key design decisions (e.g. no generic DELETE/UPDATE, role-based access) are documented and justified.
- API contract is documented with request/response shapes and error codes.
- Workflow diagram is created to visualise stage transitions and approval flow.

At this point, the system design is stable enough to begin implementation, with no ambiguity around scope, behaviour, or responsibilities.
