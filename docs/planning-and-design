Problem Statement:

F1 teams make hundreds of decisions during a race weekend, particularly around car setup changes during Practice and Qualifying. These decisions involve multiple engineers, strict time constraints, and session-based rules that restrict what can be changed once a session begins or a setup becomes locked. In practice, information is often spread across messages, spreadsheets, and verbal communication, making it difficult to clearly track what changed, who approved it, and why.

This lack of a single, reliable source of truth can lead to confusion about the current car setup, duplicate or conflicting changes, unclear responsibility for approvals, difficulty reviewing decisions after a session, and mistakes caused by time pressure or miscommunication.

The goal of this project is to design and build a workflow and decision-tracking system that provides clarity and structure during a race weekend. The system should show the current stage of the weekend, maintain versioned car setups, allow engineers to propose changes, require approvals from authorised roles, enforce session-based rules, and maintain an audit trail of all decisions. By doing so, the system aims to reduce operational errors and give teams a clear, shared understanding of decisions made under pressure.


Roles:

Engineer
- Proposes car setup changes based on driver feedback and session observations.
- Creates change requests with a clear description and reason.
- Adds notes and feedback during sessions.
- Cannot approve changes or bypass locked states.

Lead Engineer
- Reviews and approves or rejects proposed setup changes.
- Authorised to create new setup versions by approving change requests.
- Responsible for decisions made during time-critical sessions.
- Can transition the race weekend workflow between stages (e.g. Practice to Qualifying), which controls what actions are allowed at that time.


Viewer
- Has read-only access to the system.
- Can view current setups, decision history, and audit logs.
- Cannot create, modify, or approve any changes.


Workflow Stages:

Practice
- Initial setup creation and experimentation.
- Engineers can freely edit and create setup versions.
- No approval is required for changes.
- Notes and feedback are recorded for later review.

Qualifying
- Focused on performance with stricter controls.
- Existing setups become locked and cannot be edited directly.
- Engineers may propose setup changes via change requests.
- Proposed changes must be reviewed and approved by the Lead Engineer.
- All approved changes create a new versioned setup.
- All decisions are logged in the audit trail.

Race
- Maximum stability and reliability.
- Setups are fully locked and cannot be changed.
- Only notes and observations can be recorded.
- No setup changes or approvals are permitted.

Review
- Post-session analysis and reflection.
- Engineers and Leads can review setup versions, decisions, and outcomes.
- No changes to setups are allowed.
- Used to evaluate what decisions were effective and why.

API Endpoints (REST):

Conventions
- All endpoints use JSON request/response bodies.
- Role + name are provided by the client on each request (prototype approach) and enforced server-side.
- Team context is provided by the client and used to scope all data to a single team.
- The API enforces workflow rules (stage locks, permissions) and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

Definition of Done (Sprint 0)

The planning phase (Sprint 0) is considered complete when:

- The problem being solved is clearly articulated and scoped.
- User roles and responsibilities are defined and understood.
- Workflow stages and their rules are explicitly documented.
- Core data models are defined with clear purposes and fields.
- REST API endpoints are specified and aligned with the workflow.
- Key design decisions (e.g. no generic DELETE/UPDATE, role-based access) are documented and justified.
- API contract is documented with request/response shapes and error codes.
- Workflow diagram is created to visualise stage transitions and approval flow.

At this point, the system design is stable enough to begin implementation, with no ambiguity around scope, behaviour, or responsibilities.
